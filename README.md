# Marvel Comics Browser

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is a merely rails project intended to display Marvel comic books, where the
user is able to filter comics by characters and to bookmark his/her favorite
ones.

The purpose here is to be a very simple project, so there is no user managment,
which means no user registration nor user sign-in. The user data is saved in
session storage (or modern HTML5 API LocalStorage).
